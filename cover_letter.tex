\setlength{\parindent}{10ex}
I am Satrap Rathore,a third year student in the department of Computer Science and Engineering,NIT Durgapur.\par
\setlength{\parindent}{10ex}
Currently pursuing a course on Artificial Intelligence and Algorithm Design,I find my research interest to be in these vast and dynamic subjects.As a starter,I have taken up various courses on Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera,edX,programming in python using PIP.I have undertaken a department project "“Stoppage Pattern Analysis of Public Bus GPS Traces in Developing Regions” under Dr. Subrata Nandi,NIT DGP where I have to implement and design algorithms for identification of bus stops in semi-urban/rural areas using machine learning.I feel that the academic environment suits me well and some research work as a part of your team would help me fully utilize my theoretical knowledge into practical application and also serve as a strong platform for my career.\par
   \setlength{\parindent}{10ex}     I would be grateful if I could work under your guidance during the summer breakwhere in I would be able to put 6-8 weeks of my dedicated work and contribute my personal best in the process.I have attached a link to my resume with this mail.I would be glad if you could spare some time from your schedule for the evaluation of my credentials.
